Security Vulnerability Assessment of IoT Smart Doorbells Using Penetration Testing


# Methodologies and Best Practices:

Xin Liu and Arnar PÃ©tursson's studies on the ethical hacking of smart video doorbells stressed the significance of employing threat modeling and penetration testing, which influenced the decision to integrate these approaches into the project's plan.

The paper by Davis et al. concerning IoT security stances underscored the need to classify vulnerabilities and attacks, shaping the thorough strategy for assessing various threat categories such as physical, network, software, and encryption.

Specific Vulnerabilities and Solutions:

Studying different smart doorbell case studies gave a good grasp of typical security weaknesses like poor password encryption and data exposure, which helped me identify key areas for conducting penetration tests.

2. Technology Review Influence:

Tool Selection:

The detailed analysis of tools like OWASP ZAP, Nmap, Nessus, and Burp Suite informed the selection of these tools for their specific strengths in web application scanning, network reconnaissance, and vulnerability assessment .
The combination of these tools ensures comprehensive coverage of both network-level and application-level vulnerabilities, as recommended in the technology review.
Project Scope and Objectives:

The reviews emphasized the need to utilize a variety of tools to address different security concerns, thereby expanding the project's focus to encompass evaluations of both web interface and network infrastructure security.
The goal of the project is to improve the security of the HIKvision Video Doorbell, which is in line with the recognized requirement for strong security measures on various IoT devices as emphasized in the literature.
Integration and Methodology Refinement:

The project will utilize these tools identified in the literature review to create a comprehensive penetration testing strategy, guaranteeing a methodical and comprehensive evaluation process.
The project will adopt Agile methodology to remain flexible and iterative, addressing vulnerabilities identified during the testing phases efficiently.
